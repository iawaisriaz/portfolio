# Personal Portfolio Website

I am creating this website as a personal portfolio to showcase my work and practice my HTML and CSS skills. This project allows me to improve my web development abilities by building a visually appealing site from scratch. Through this portfolio, I aim to highlight my design sense, demonstrate my technical knowledge, and share the projects I have worked on. It's a hands-on learning experience that helps me better understand web standards and enhance my coding proficiency as I work toward becoming a full-stack developer.

## Features
- Simple HTML and CSS structure
- Use of display flex and position absolute
- Static layout (not responsive)
- Image replacement option for customization
